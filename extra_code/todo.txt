1. Cut if vertical mid is 100% white (continuous)

2. Cut if vertical mid is > 95% white (continuous)

3. ###Done### Find range of character width

4. Characters width greater than maximum width should be passed from filter

5. Is shirorekha white? If yes, it means either dha or bha

6. ###Done### Find out avg character width and then find out uncut chars

7. line extraction: limit is not single white line. examine multiple continuous whitelines

1. ###Done###  NEVER LOOSE INFORMATION: Change structure of code to keep information about which character belongs to which word. 
  Store word no. and character no. in that word.

2. ###Done### Find out mean width of characters

3. Apply second filter for those characters which are larger than x% of mean width (clumped characters). Keep information about these characters that they were passed through second filter. It tells a lot about the character.

4. Iterate over value of x (see point 3) to find a good value which doesn't break single characters.

5. Break each character into upper, mid and lower region

6. We will use certain font size and then we would do scaling after that

1. When character Ais(line 4, word 2, char 0) is cut, sa also cuts in two half.

Solution: Find width of char. If it is less than 2*mean_width, then two chars are clumped in it. Find all valleys in char. And the valley nearer to half line of char would be the line of split.

1. Divide words into upper mid and lower region and then we will analyse later.

Solution : Firstly, word was divided into characters with old method (which was a bit clumsy). Then length of each char in the word is measured and mean length of chars is calculated (in that word). If any char's length is greater than the mean and the difference is above a threshold(some % of mean), then it is taken as a probable case for having a lower modifier.
If any char does have a lower modifier, then word is split to get the lower region. For finding the lower region, we find no. of chars having lower modifer (say n), then sort(decreasing order) chars by length and take n+1(th) char's length as start point of lower region.
